What would you require to do this job? Specify items such as: where, how and who must be able to maintain the product to correct errors, hardware failures, etc.; required support/troubleshooting manuals/guides; availability/documentation of source code; related technical documentation that must be available for maintainers; specific/unique tools required for maintenance; specific software/environment required for maintenance; etc.
